<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Codeflix, a new streaming platform for learning videos, wants to understand how many users stop subscribing over time (churn rate). We'll be helping them answer these key questions:

1. Company Background:

How long has Codeflix been around?
For which months can we calculate churn?
Are there different user groups (segments) on the platform?

2. Churn Trend:

How has the overall churn rate changed since launch?
3. Segment Comparison:

Do different user segments churn at different rates?
4. Growth Focus:

Based on churn, which user segment should Codeflix prioritize for growth?
